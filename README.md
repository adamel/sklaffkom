Sklaffkom is a Swedish, command based BBS system (also known as [KOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOM_(bulletin_board_system))) written for SunOS, BSD and later (sort-of) ported to Linux. 

It was never meant to be a complete, permanent BBS system but rather a temporary solution in wait for the grand new big BBS system that arrived 10+ years later in the form of EasyKOM. 

This version, 1.32, is the last version released by the team behind Sklaffkom- It has later been patched to compile on the 32-bit x86 versions of FreeBSD 12 and OpenBSD 6. 

At some point, this should probably also be updated again to compile on 64-bit systems and later versions of FreeBSD and OpenBSD (and hopefully Linux but who knows). Attempts has been made to compile Sklaffkom on OpenBSD 7.4 running on SPARC64 but it didn't work. 

Attempts are now being made to compile this code in FreeBSD 14.2-RELEASE (64-bit).  Thoughts and prayers, etc.
